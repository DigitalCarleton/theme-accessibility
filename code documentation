Assume as a standalone :- 

Eq:- We made 3 changes , needs modification in 
First problem:- there is no h1 level 
Idea.php - homepage 
Default value - it will be nice to change the value for people 
So you need config, ini and how you do these
What section fo codes whose the codes be entered

Although Omeka has incorporated some of the accessibility features like ARIA Landmarks, skip to the content, 
it still needs significant improvements. Here, we identified three features where the theme needed modifications and 
made changes accordingly. 

1. Header text for heading level 1 in homepage.
Lack of a unique h1 makes the website less intuitive and more complex to navigate for screen readers. 
Hence, it is very important to add it. It would also be nice for users to change the h1 header text, 
however it should also have a default text in case the users do no input one.

Note:- all codes added for the header text are commeted with #added for header text in the relevant files. 

1.1. To add the Header text input field in theme configuration. 

Go to config.ini file:

i. Add the following codes under [config] section. This builds the text form for the header text. 

```
header_text.type = "textarea"
header_text.options.label = "Header Text"
header_text.options.description = "Add some text to be displayed in your theme's header."
header_text.options.rows = "1"
header_text.options.attribs.class = "html-input"
```

ii. Add the following codes under [groups] section, but right before the homepage text. This displays
the text form for the header text on the theme configuration. 
```
head_foot.elements[] = "header_text"
```


ii. To add the header text in the public page

Go to header.php file:

Add the following code:
```
 <div id = "header">
            <?php
            $h1Text = get_theme_option('Header Text');
            if ($h1Text == null):
                $h1Text = 'Header Text';
            endif;
            ?>
            <h1><?php echo $h1Text; ?></h1>
            </div>
```
($h1Text == null) checks if the user has input the header text, other wise the default value Header Text is displayed on the 
homepage.

2. Simple Design
Simple Design lets the users process the important information quickly without being burdened by distractions. It includes
consistent format, high contrast and flat design. 

2.1. Remove all the border lines
This makes the page less cluttered and gives the page a flat desing look that is visually pleasing.
